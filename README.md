# GUI

Source code for GUI website.

Built using [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/). Hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

[View it at the following address: https://jasond94.github.io/GUI](https://jasond94.github.io/GUI)

Note: you can also view the page at [http://downing.io/GUI/](http://downing.io/GUI/) since I applied a custom domain to my jasond94.github.io repository / personal website. This apparently applies to ALL other GitHub Pages that I host on GitHub. As a result, either link works the same!

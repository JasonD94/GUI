    This page is for assignment #9, "Scrabble".

    It will contain a full feature Scrabble game that will do tons of fun stuff
    like connect to external APIs, make use of the jQuery UI library, and even
    score / check for valid words / etc.


    NOTE ABOUT BOOTSTRAP GRID SYSTEM AND SCREEN RESOLUTIONS:
    I have modified Bootstrap by custom compiling my own version.

    My version has the following properties:
    14 column grid system (not 12)
    col-md activates at 1250px width (not 922px)
    col-lg activates at 1900px width (not 1200px)

    Compiled at this website: http://getbootstrap.com/customize/?id=78029697512ef0d88bbc

          <p class="left_align_highlight">I have implemented a full Scrabble board game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
          The game fully supports playing one word, and I have also added support for saving words
          and continuing to play more of them. There are very few bugs for playing one word – I am
          able to restrict placement of tiles and where tiles can go. For playing multiple words it
          becomes very complex to restrict placement so there are a few bugs that crop up that I will
          try to fix in the next few days before the December 9th due date.</p>

          <!-- Features that are present -->
          <p class="under_line">Features present in this version of Scrabble include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Playing a single word, along with scoring for basic / double / triple tiles.</li>
            <li>Playing multiple words, and scoring continues to add with each played word.</li>
            <li>“Letters Remaining” table updates as tiles are used and allows the user to see how many of a certain letter is remaining.</li>
            <li>“Swap a tile” space is a droppable target that, when a tile a is dropped on it,
            replaces that tile with a random letter and moves back to the previous location (rack / game board)</li>
            <li>Tiles can also be swapped – for the current word being played, just drop a tile on top of another tile,
            and the two will switch places (the old tile returns to the rack and the new tile is played)</li>
            <li>Three buttons control submitting a word (saving a word to the game board so that you can play multiple words in one game),
            recalling tiles (this moves all tiles of the CURRENT word back to the rack. It does not mess with played tiles, which are part
            of saved words), and resetting the game board (which completely resets the board so that a new game of Scrabble can be played instead).</li>
            <li>Warning and Success messages appear when needed, such as "Start at the start" and "Place tiles at right angles".</li>
            <li>As a result, for creating one word, start at the middle star, and create a word in a straight line, either up and down or left and right.</li>
            <li>For creating multiple words, add onto the middle of a word. See example screen shots below.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight_centered_smaller">
          <!-- BUGS, BUGS, BUGS ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ -->
          <p class="under_line">Current bugs:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Blank tiles are not implemented (if I have time I may implement them)</li>
            <li>Multiple words can cause the displayed word to show up incorrectly, especially when swapping tiles and changing the tiles around.</li>
            <p class="basic_tab">If bugs occur with the current word, I recommend hitting the “recall tiles” button to reset the CURRENT word while maintaining the game board as is.</p>
            <li>Adding on to already created words isn’t fully implemented.</li>
            <p class="basic_tab">I basically take just the first letter and add it to the current word.
            This allows playing multiple words off of the middle of already created words, but if you try to add an “S” to the end of a word it won’t show the entire word.
            If I have time before the deadline I may be able to fully implement this.</p>
            <li>Scoring for special spaces on multiple words causes the entire word to double / triple on "double word" and "triple word" spaces.</li>
            <p class="basic_tab">I may be able to fix this.</p>
          </ul>

        <div class="highlight_centered_smaller">
          <!-- Screen resolution is important. -->
          <p class="under_line">The biggest issue is SCREEN RESOLUTION.</p>
          <p class="left_align_highlight">
          I have tested the game on a full HD monitor / laptop, and it displays fine.
          If you test this webpage on a smaller resolution device, it may display weird.
          There may be some scrolling to get to the tiles, or to the submit / reset buttons.
          I have tried messing with the Bootstrap grid to fix this, but it is a known problem with my web page.
          I recommend, if possible, viewing this webpage on a 1920 by 1080 resolution screen.
          Otherwise trying hitting F11 and make sure the browser is in full screen mode.
          It will likely display better, although you may need to hit F5 to refresh the page after doing this (the tiles may appear weird otherwise).</p>

          <p class="left_align_highlight">(The main reason for the screen resolution issue is I force the table to
          be a grid of 15 by 15 cells, each 50 by 50 pixels wide. As a result the table itself requires 750px by 750px.
          I think this looks the best and reducing the size at all would make the game board tiny and hard to read.
          If I have time I may try to make a second table that is smaller and force that to display on smaller screens)</p>

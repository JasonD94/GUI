        Created: September 3rd, 2015.
        Last Updated: September 9th, at 4PM.

        Note: much of this design comes from a previous personal website that I built over the summer.
        I've redesigned this one, using much of the same <head> but redoing nearly all of the body.
        Some of the CSS is similar or reused, but most of it was changed.
        I also added multiple pages and the navigation bar at the top. The navigation bar has a dropdown menu titled "Index"
        that will contain links to future projects and assignments.

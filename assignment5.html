    This is a page for the 5th assignment. It mainly consists of a div with the id "place_json_here", and a 
    YouTube iframe. The YouTube video is the music video for the song "Sleep Now In The Fire" by 
    Rage Against The Machine. I load a JSON file called lyrics.json into the "place_json_here" div,
    and I then style the text dynamically using CSS. The JSON file contains the title, artist and song lyrics
    to the song in the YouTube video displayed on this page (Sleep Now In The Fire).

        For assignment 5, we formatted dynamic text that was loaded onto the
        page by using JavaScript. This text was also stored in JSON
        format, and I wrote a JavaScript file named "json.js" to parse the JSON file
        and add classes, which could be styled in a CSS file. </div>

        This div will have JSON placed inside of it.
        The json.js file will place it here, and the json.css file will style
        this text.

        The song lyrics in this JSON file come off of Rage Against The Machines
        website: http://www.ratm.net/lyrics/sle.html

        I used the JSON editor website to double check this JSON file as well:
        http://www.jsoneditoronline.org/

        Also, the lyrics are inside of an object, which is slightly different then
        how Prof. Heines did it. I probably should have put them inside of arrays
        since that would have been easier to access when using for loops, but I
        figured out how to use objects anyway so it works the same.  -->
        <div id="place_json_here">
          Testing 1 2 3.
          This text won't appear once I load up the JSON in the json.js file.
          In fact, the song lyrics will magically appear instead.
          How cool.

        I also added the "valid HTML and CSS" script here, to show my site validates properly.

        The HTML5 / CSS3 Logos are from the following sites:

        I also used the following site as a guide for doing this, although I modified it so that the image shows up with the
        text as a link as well.

        Note: this file is somewhat a copy of index.html, with the body changed to reflect what I did for assignment 1.
        I did this to keep the same look and Nav bar as my index.html file, but still be able to change text  and add stuff.
        I left all the comments in tact as well for future reference.

                        I completed the following tasks:

                                Highlighting didn't show up for some reason, so I added it here as well.
                                w3schools yet again was really helpful for figuring this out.
                                I used both of the following sites for help:
                                http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_ol.asp
                                http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_ul.asp -->
                        <ol class="highlight">
                            <li> Complete Course Registration

                                        technically this assignment is optional. Also, why not mess around with them?
                                        And I added random helpful links in case people check out this page.

                                        Also, side note, I had to include the <ul> tags inside of the <li> tag for the <ol>.
                                        Otherwise, w3 validator complained.
                                        Stackoverflow was once again helpful with explaining this:

                                    forum and checked it out over the next few days.</li>
                                    <li>Finally I did the pre-course survey.</li>

                                    I just ran "sudo apt-get install apache2" on my Linux machine </li>
                                    <li> Then I spent a while configuring Apache.
                                            I made a public_html folder and got stuff to display on local host. </li>
                                    <li> Then I saw a link on Piazza about Python's simple server. And it was way easier to use. </li>
